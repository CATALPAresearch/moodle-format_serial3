# Development

- run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- change to folder `vue` and run in terminal `npm run build` to transpile changes from in vue to js

**Dependencies**

- Moodle v4.5 or newer
- vue.js v2, vuex
- d3.js
- vue-grid-layout library (https://jbaysolutions.github.io/vue-grid-layout/)

**Getting started**

api.php: In this file you'll find the SQL queries. All API get or post requests implement webservices. The naming
conventions are very strict. Take care to to follow the nameing schema for the functions.

db/services.php: Here your are defining the webservice by referencing the involved files (api.php and its containing
classes and functions)

version.php: Every time you are changing the webservice description in service.php you need to increment the version by
1 and update the plugin in moodle (See the _notifications_ page in the administration panel)

amd/scr: This is the folder where all custome javascript is located. You should not change any file there since it is the output folder for transpiled and optimized code.

/amd/app-lazy.min.js: This is the only script that is called by the HTML-DOM of the plugin. By using require.js all other
files and dependencies are loaded on demand in this file and passed to the components underneath.

/vue: This is the folder where all code for the Vue application is stored.

/vue/js: This the folder where all third party javascript is stored.

/vue/store: This folder contains all files related to the vuex store.

/vue/components: This folder contains all components for the dashboard. In the 'widgets' folder all widgets-components
are stored that are being called by 'App.vue'.

/vue/scripts: This folder contains utility functions.

/vue/data: This data contains data used in the dashboard stored as json. This data includes the adaptation-rules and
thresholds.
